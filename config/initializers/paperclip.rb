# Paperclip allows file attachments that are stored in the filesystem. All graphical
# transformations are done using the Graphics/ImageMagick command line utilities and
# are stored in Tempfiles until the record is saved. Paperclip does not require a
# separate model for storing the attachment's information, instead adding a few simple
# columns to your table.

# Paperclip defines an attachment as any file, though it makes special considerations
# for image files. You can declare that a model has an attached file with the
# +has_attached_file+ method:
#
#   class User < ActiveRecord::Base
#     has_attached_file :avatar, :styles => { :thumb => "100x100" }
#   end
#
#   user = User.new
#   user.avatar = params[:user][:avatar]
#   user.avatar.url
#   # => "/users/avatars/4/original_me.jpg"
#   user.avatar.url(:thumb)
#   # => "/users/avatars/4/thumb_me.jpg"
#
# See the +has_attached_file+ documentation for more details.
